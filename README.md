# Frontend Mentor - Four card feature section

![Design preview for the Four card feature section coding challenge](./Project%20Requirements/design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## 🌍 Overview

This little component is a beginner project from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/four-card-feature-section-weK1eFYK/hub). I wanted to build this project to stay connected to my CSS skills.

As with any skill, if you don't use it, you lose it. 😫 So this little build is a part of my ongoing professional development.

You can see a couple of other little, cutie builds [here](https://github.com/crwainstock/fe-mentor-product-preview) and [here](https://github.com/crwainstock/fe-mentor-3-column-preview-card) and [here](https://github.com/crwainstock/fe-mentor-single-price-grid).

## 🛠️ Technologies & Dependencies

This component was built with HTML and vanilla CSS. No dependencies! 🥳 I also used [PerfectPixel](https://www.welldonecode.com/perfectpixel/) and the [Eye Dropper/Color Picker](https://eyedropper.org/) browser extensions to help with the build.

I deployed the component with Netlify, though, so check that out [here](https://preeminent-selkie-6685c8.netlify.app/).

## 🤔 Reflection

This build was good practing using grid again. With the mobile view, the cards are in a single column, which is where I started. But with the larger view, the cards are kind of in a staggered grid pattern. This is the first time I've built a layout like this, and it was kind of fun.

One part of this build that was kind of challenging was related to sizing and placement of the cards and text, specifically related to padding, border, and margins. I spent a good amount of time making tiny, tiny changes to all kinds of font-size, margin-top, padding-bottom properties to try to align the build with the brief image. While PerfectPixel allows for easy comparison in the browser, it's still tedious to get everything aligned appropriately.
